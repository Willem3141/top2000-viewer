top2000-viewer
==============

A website to show the currently playing song in the Top 2000. The Top 2000 is an annual event on the Dutch radio station Radio 2 where listeners can vote on the songs they like most; then the 2000 best songs are played. See [this site](http://www.radio2.nl/top2000).

The website uses Node.js. The server-side fetches the currently-playing song from the Radio 2 site and matches it to the Top 2000 song list. It also does some further processing. Then, clients just get this information from the server and display it.

A happy new year in advance :)

top2000-viewer
==============

A small QML program to show the currently playing song in the Top 2000. The Top 2000 is an annual event on the Dutch radio station Radio 2 where listeners can vote on the songs they like most; then the 2000 best songs are played. See [http://www.radio2.nl/top2000].

Run `qmlscene-qt5 Top2000.qml` (or just `qmlscene Top2000.qml` - this depends on your distribution) to launch the program.

A happy new year in advance :)
